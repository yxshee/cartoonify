Cartoonify - A GAN-based Image-to-Image Translation Tool

This package provides tools to transform regular photographs into cartoon-style images
using a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) architecture. The implementation uses
a conditional GAN with a U-Net generator and a PatchGAN discriminator.

Main components:
- Generator: Transforms input images into cartoon-style images
- Discriminator: Differentiates between real and generated cartoon images
- Dataset: Handles loading and preprocessing of image pairs
- Training: Scripts for model training
- Inference: Tools for applying the trained model to new images

For usage examples, see the README.md file.
